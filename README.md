Data Dialogue is an interactive web application that empowers you to engage in dynamic conversations with your data, unlocking its hidden secrets and revolutionizing the way you analyze and interpret information.

## Introduction

Data Dialogue combines the power of Langchain and Pandas DataFrame to provide an innovative way of generating Python code based on the conversations you have with your data.

5. Save the .env file.
6. Open the terminal in the project directory and run:
